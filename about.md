The blog is mainly about using open software to analyze large data-sets in ocean and climate sciences.

Hopefully it will help spread useful code at the same time improving them.

Posts on discussions in ocean and climate sciences, fluid dynamics and financial analysis are also planned.

It may also contain material on other things that interest me, such as drones and drone aerial imagery.

And of course, surfing.

More about the author on his homepage.
